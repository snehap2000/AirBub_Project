## Key Features

## 1.Data Cleaning and Preparation :
Handling missing values
Renaming columns for consistency
Converting data types for better processing.


## 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analysis of pricing trends across different locations
Insights into room types and their availability
Identification of popular listings based on reviews and occupancy.


## 3. Visualization:
Charts and graphs to illustrate key insights.
Histograms for price distributions.
Bar charts for room type comparisons.


## 4. Insights:
Price Trends: Listings in popular tourist areas tend to have higher prices compared to suburban or rural areas.

Availability Patterns: Properties with higher review counts tend to have higher occupancy rates.

Customer Preferences: Guests prefer entire homes/apartments over shared rooms, indicating a demand for privacy.

Seasonal Demand: Prices and bookings peak during holiday seasons and major local events.


## Host Engagement: Listings with responsive hosts and better amenities receive more positive reviews and higher bookings.



## Tools and Libraries Used:

Python: Core programming language for data analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for combining code, visualizations, and narrative text.
Kaggle : To use the AirBnB Listings & Reviews Dataset .




## Future Enhancements :
Integration of machine learning models to predict Airbnb prices.
Automated dashboards for real-time data visualization.
